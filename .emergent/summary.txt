The previous AI engineer successfully evolved a web-based printing cost calculator from an MVP to a robust application with complex features. Initial work focused on implementing Booklet Mode and Multi-part Printing, unifying UI elements, and integrating a FastAPI backend with MongoDB for persistent data. A significant portion of the work involved refining calculation logic, particularly for booklet mode's 1 cover = 4 pages and 1 inner sheet = 2/4 pages rules, and adding input validation. Subsequent iterations tackled critical calculation bugs related to binding edge logic and incorrect halving for booklet covers and inner pages. The engineer also added confirmation dialogs for deletions, removed the 'Duplex Support' checkbox, ensured calculation consistency between Normal and Booklet modes, optimized print sheet selection by considering product rotation, and recently implemented a comprehensive Extras system for finishing options with flexible pricing. The last ongoing task is to display booklet extras separately for cover and inner pages.

<product_requirements>
The application is a web-based printing cost calculator that computes production costs based on intricate job specifications.
1.  **Core Calculation**: Calculate total production costs (paper, click, setup) and per-unit costs, optimizing product fit per sheet.
2.  **Machine & Paper Management**: Machines support multiple print sheet sizes; paper types support multiple stock sizes. Backend persistence via MongoDB is required for user-defined paper types and machines.
3.  **Printing Options**: Support single/double-sided printing (double-sided doubles click cost).
4.  **Cover Integration**: Optional Has Cover feature for separate paper/machine selection.
5.  **Booklet Mode**: A dedicated mode for booklet jobs, displaying Inner Paper/Machine Selection, Total Pages, and calculating costs for inner/cover pages separately. Quantity becomes number of booklets.
6.  **Multi-Part Printing**: Allow specifying different paper/machine/page counts for sections of inner pages in both Normal and Booklet modes.
7.  **UI/Validation**: Setup Required defaults to unchecked. Multi-part sections hide default paper/machine. Validation ensures multi-part pages match total job pages.
8.  **Calculation Logic**: Correctly apply 1 cover = 4 pages and 1 inner sheet = 2/4 pages logic for booklet mode.
9.  **Binding Edge**: In booklet mode, users select short or long edge binding, influencing calculations.
10. **Extras Section**: Implement an Extras section for finishing options (e.g., lamination, binding), allowing pricing per page, per booklet, or based on length (bound edge in booklet mode; user-selected edge in normal mode).
11. **Default States**: 'Has Cover' should be unselected by default; 'Double-Sided' should be selected by default.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React application entry point, handling routing, global state (paper types, machines, extras), and data fetching.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  for data fetching, moved from mock data. Added state and handlers for , including , , , . Added a dedicated Extras tab in the UI navigation and passed  to .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains core calculation logic for optimal sheet selection, click costs, duplex printing, cover costs, and complex booklet mode calculations.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified for booklet mode (,  rules). Implemented binding edge logic for cover and inner page calculations (doubling the binding edge dimension for effective size). Refined  to try both product orientations. Introduced  to compute costs based on per page, per booklet, or per length, with dynamic edge selection. Initial machine mock data was extended to include a 330x695 (Large Format) print sheet size to support larger booklet dimensions.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The central UI component for printing cost calculation, state, and logic.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive state additions for , , , , . UI for Binding Edge selection was added. Fixed a type mismatch bug. Defaulted Setup Required to . Total Click Cost display in booklet mode was changed to Total. Implemented Has Cover checkbox for booklet mode, making cover optional and adjusting inner page calculations. Updated default values for  (false) and  (true). Integrated  state and UI, including dynamic edge selection for length-based extras. The display for results (Normal, Booklet Cover, Booklet Inner) was refactored to show a simplified, consistent set of key metrics in a more readable format. Fixed a bug where  was not passed to the job object. Logic for  and  was corrected to apply doubling logic *only* in Booklet Mode.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages machine definitions and their print sheet sizes.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted for  array and integrated with backend API. Removed the Duplex Support checkbox and its associated state/logic. Added confirmation dialog before deleting machines.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages paper type definitions and stock sheet sizes.
    -   **Changes**: Adapted for  array and integrated with backend API. Added confirmation dialog before deleting paper types.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI backend for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded significantly to include full CRUD endpoints for , , and  with MongoDB persistence. Added default data initialization for paper types, machines, and extras. Updated the  Pydantic model to make  optional () to prevent validation errors from frontend changes.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Centralized file for API calls to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented functions for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting paper types, machines, and new  endpoints, using .

<pending_tasks>
- Update the results display to show cover and inner pages extras separately in Booklet Mode.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has been working on implementing an Extras section to allow users to add finishing options like lamination or binding. This involved significant work across the stack:
-   **Backend ()**: New API endpoints () were created for CRUD operations, complete with Pydantic models for validation and MongoDB persistence. Default extras (e.g., Cellophane Lamination, Staple Binding) were initialized in the database.
-   **Frontend API Service ()**: Corresponding API service functions were added to handle communication with the new backend endpoints for extras.
-   **Extras Manager Component ()**: A new dedicated component was created to allow users to manage these extras, define their name, price, and how they are priced (per page, per booklet/unit, or per length). Confirmation dialogs were added for deletions.
-   **App Integration ()**: The  was integrated into the main application, including state management for extras, loading them from the backend, and adding a new Extras tab for navigation.
-   **Calculator Integration ()**: The  was updated to receive the list of available . UI elements were added to the calculator to allow users to select multiple extras. New state variables (, ) were introduced to manage user selections.
-   **Calculation Logic ()**: A new function  was implemented to compute the cost for selected extras based on their pricing type. This function intelligently handles length-based pricing, using the bound edge in Booklet Mode and requiring user selection (short/long edge) in Normal Mode.
-   **Display Logic ()**: The calculated extras costs were integrated into the total cost and a new section was added to the results display to show a detailed breakdown of each selected extra's cost.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of refining the display of extras in Booklet Mode, aiming to show them separately for the cover and inner pages to reflect distinct finishing applications. The engineer updated the state, UI selection, and calculation logic for this separation, and was about to update the results display.
