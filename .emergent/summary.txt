The previous AI engineer successfully developed a complex web-based printing cost calculator from scratch, implementing core logic, UI, and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Key advancements included sophisticated booklet mode calculations, multi-part printing, and an elaborate Extras management system with variants and single/double-sided options. The recent phase focused on critical bug fixes and feature enhancements. Initial work involved adding PDF generation (which proved challenging, leading to blank PDFs and dual implementation with  and /). This was followed by comprehensive currency selection integration across all price-bearing entities (extras, machines, paper types). Subsequently, the per print sheet pricing for extras evolved from a separate type to a dynamic apply to print sheet dimensions checkbox, modifying existing pricing. The latest efforts were dominated by extensive debugging of extras calculation inaccuracies, specifically resolving  values, incorrect unit usage, and property mismatches, culminating in a fix for  not being used for print sheet calculations.

<product_requirements>
The application is a web-based printing cost calculator designed for intricate job specifications, calculating total production costs (paper, click, setup) and per-unit costs while optimizing product fit per sheet.
**Implemented Features:**
1.  **Machine & Paper Management:** CRUD operations for machines and paper types, supporting multiple print/stock sheet sizes, with data persisted in MongoDB.
2.  **Printing Options:** Single/double-sided printing, where double-sided doubles click cost.
3.  **Booklet Mode:** Dedicated mode with Inner Paper/Machine Selection, Total Pages, and separate calculations for inner/cover pages (quantity represents booklets).
4.  **Cover Integration:** Optional Has Cover feature with separate paper/machine selection.
5.  **Multi-Part Printing:** Different paper/machine/page counts for sections of inner pages in Normal and Booklet modes.
6.  **Calculation Logic:** Precise 1 cover = 4 pages and 1 inner sheet = 2/4 pages logic for booklet mode, correct binding edge influence (short/long edge).
7.  **Extras Section:** Finishing options with flexible pricing (per page, per booklet, per length). Supports multiple variants, inside/outside same setting, length in centimeters. Extras can be applied single-sided or double-sided (doubling price).
8.  **Currency Support:** Individual currency selection (USD, EUR, TRY) for each extra, machine, and paper type, storing and displaying its own selected currency.
9.  **Apply to Print Sheet Checkbox:** Modifies existing pricing methods (e.g., 'per_length') to use print sheet dimensions/count instead of individual page dimensions/count when checked. When selected, always uses the long side (45.0cm) for length-based calculations.
10. **Duplicate Prevention:** Extras are not re-added when UI changes are made.
11. **PDF Generation:** A Print button generates a PDF of the output, including all details and Final Total Price, with attempts to fit content on a single page and proper branding (Print and Smile).
12. **UI/Validation:** Setup Required defaults to unchecked; Multi-part sections hide default paper/machine; Multi-part pages match total pages; Normal Mode displays single best calculation; Final Total Price shown; 'Has Cover' unselected by default; 'Double-Sided' selected by default.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the extras calculation logic to use the actual calculated print sheets needed (e.g., 4 sheets) instead of the job's  (e.g., 100 units) when the Apply to Print Sheet Dimensions option is selected for an extra.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most immediate work revolved around debugging and fixing incorrect extra pricing calculations. The user reported that the  was still calculating incorrectly or displaying as 0, despite multiple previous fixes. Extensive debugging, including detailed console logs, revealed that while the  calculation itself was producing a correct non-zero value (e.g., 32cm), the value being stored in the final result object, and thus displayed, was 0. This was traced to a variable shadowing issue where a  declaration inside a  case block was overriding a function-level  variable. This specific shadowing was fixed by removing the duplicate declaration.

However, a new issue arose where the calculated Print Sheets Needed (e.g., 4) was not being correctly utilized by the extras calculation; instead, the  (e.g., 100) was being used, leading to an inflated print sheet count in the extra's cost display. The user explicitly highlighted this discrepancy with a screenshot and console output. The AI engineer diagnosed that the . This indicates a need to align the  parameter used in extra calculations with the dynamically calculated  when the Apply to Print Sheet Dimensions checkbox is active.
