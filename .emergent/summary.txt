The AI engineer successfully progressed the printing cost calculator MVP through several critical phases. Initial efforts focused on currency handling, moving exchange rate display, and fixing a bug where it was mistakenly removed and then restored. Concurrently, binding edge logic was refined, removing its selection from normal mode while preserving it in booklet mode. A significant improvement involved enhancing decimal formatting for extra unit prices, ensuring precision for very small values. The Inside/Outside = Same extras logic was fixed to correctly align with the Has Cover setting. Furthermore, robust duplication functionality was added for paper types and machines, addressing a crucial bug related to float IDs. Drag-and-drop reordering was implemented for machine print sizes and paper types. Finally, two new complex features were added: Per Form Pricing for extras, with GSM-based calculations and rounding, and a configurable Setup Cost for individual extras, mirroring machine setup costs. The work involved iterative debugging, especially for ID generation and drag-and-drop state management.

<product_requirements>
The application is a web-based printing cost calculator designed for complex print jobs, focusing on optimizing product fit per sheet and calculating total production costs (paper, click, setup) and per-unit costs.

**Currently Implemented Features:**
1.  **Machine & Paper Management:** CRUD operations for machines and paper types, supporting multi-sheet sizes and persistent storage in MongoDB.
2.  **Printing Options:** Supports single and double-sided printing configurations.
3.  **Booklet Mode:** A dedicated mode that includes inner/cover paper/machine selection, total page calculations (1 cover = 4 pages, 1 sheet = 2/4 pages logic), and binding edge influence.
4.  **Cover Integration:** Optional cover with separate paper and machine selections.
5.  **Multi-Part Printing:** Allows different settings for various inner page sections.
6.  **Extras Section:** Offers flexible pricing models (per page, per booklet, per length) with variants and single/double-sided options. The Apply to Print Sheet checkbox uses print sheet dimensions for pricing.
7.  **Currency Support:** All calculations and displays are normalized to EUR using live exchange rates fetched from , with a subtle display of  and  rates.
8.  **Duplicate Prevention:** Ensures extras are not re-added accidentally.
9.  **PDF Generation:** A Print button facilitates PDF output of job details.
10. **Binding Edge Logic:** Independent selection for cover and inner pages in booklet mode, defaulting to Long Edge Binding. The binding edge selection has been removed from normal mode for a cleaner interface.
11. **UI/UX Refinements:** Includes default settings for Setup Required and multi-part hiding, precise total page matching, clear display of best calculations, default 'Has Cover' unselected, 'Double-Sided' default, removal of Made with Emergent watermark, and a subtle display of live exchange rates above the main tabs.
12. **Enhanced Decimal Formatting:** Extras unit prices now display up to 4 decimal places where necessary to prevent rounding small values to zero.
13. **Inside/Outside = Same Extras Logic:** Correctly displays these extras only under the Cover section if Has Cover is selected, or under the Inner Pages section if not, ensuring single, correct placement and accurate calculation for both parts.
14. **Duplication Functionality:** Paper entries and machine entries can now be duplicated, copying all properties and generating new, valid integer IDs for nested items (stock/print sheet sizes).
15. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Print Sizes for machines and Paper Types can be manually reordered using drag-and-drop.
16. **Autocomplete Paper Selection:** The paper selection dropdowns on the calculation screen now support live filtering by typing.
17. **Per Form Pricing (New):** A new pricing type for extras that calculates cost based on forms (total pages divided by 12 or 16, rounded up, depending on paper grammage).
18. **Changeable Setup Cost for Extras (New):** Extras can now have an optional, changeable one-time setup cost (similar to machines), which is added to the total job cost and supports multiple currencies.

<pending_tasks>
- For extras in Booklet Mode, add an option that lets the user choose where the extra should be applied: ‘Cover only’, ‘Inner pages only’, or ‘Both’. Based on this selection, the extra should only appear in the corresponding section(s) of the calculation screen, and should only be included in the price calculation for the selected part(s).

<current_work>
The application is a comprehensive printing cost calculator with significant feature additions and refinements.
The immediate preceding work focused on two major feature implementations: **Per Form Pricing for Extras** and **Changeable Setup Cost for Extras**.

**Per Form Pricing:** A new  pricing type was added for extras. This calculation dynamically determines the number of forms based on the total number of pages and the selected paper's grammage: if the paper's GSM is 170 or higher, pages are divided by 12; otherwise, they are divided by 16. The result is always rounded up using . This logic was implemented in the  function in , requiring paper type data to be passed to it. The  UI was updated to include Per Form Pricing as a selectable option, and display logic across the application now reflects this new unit (€/form). Backend APIs were verified to correctly accept and persist this new pricing type.

**Changeable Setup Cost for Extras:** Each extra can now have an optional, one-time setup cost, similar to machine setup costs. This involved adding  and  fields to the  data models in  (Pydantic models and MongoDB interactions) and updating CRUD operations (, ). On the frontend,  was modified to include input fields for setup cost and its currency within the Add/Edit Extra form. The  function in  was updated to add this  (converted to EUR) to the total cost of the extra. The UI also displays these setup costs prominently, ensuring they are accounted for in calculations.

Before these, recent critical work included successfully debugging and implementing:
*   **Duplication Functionality:** Fixed a persistent Failed to add error for paper and machine duplication by ensuring new stock/print sheet size IDs generated on the frontend were integers () instead of floats.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Made drag-and-drop for paper types fully functional, including visual updates and data persistence, by ensuring  was correctly handled in  and IDs were converted to strings for . Drag-and-drop for machine print sizes was also implemented and verified.
*   **Autocomplete Paper Selection:** Implemented an  component and integrated it into all paper selection dropdowns, allowing live filtering by typing.
*   **Decimal Place Formatting:** Enhanced display logic to show up to 4 decimal places for small extra unit prices using a dynamic formatting function.
*   **Inside/Outside = Same Extras Logic:** Fixed the display and calculation of consolidated extras to correctly appear only in the cover section (if 'Has Cover' is true) or inner section (if 'Has Cover' is false), ensuring single display and correct calculation across both parts.

The application is currently in a state where new extras can be created with 'Per Form Pricing' and optional 'Setup Costs', and existing features like duplication, reordering, and autocomplete are fully operational and visually consistent.

<optional_next_step>
I will begin implementing the Booklet Application Scope functionality for extras, adding an option to apply extras to 'Cover only', 'Inner pages only', or 'Both'.
